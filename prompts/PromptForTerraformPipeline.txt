Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml) for Terraform EKS infrastructure with these features:

1. *Pipeline Triggers*: MR events, main branch pushes, scheduled runs (block feature branches)

2. *Stages*: validate → plan → apply → drift-detection → notify → destroy

3. *Configuration*:
   - need to add GitLab HTTP backend authentication for Terraform state with proper locking mechanism as environment variables. 
   - Cache .terraform directory
   - Tags: ec2 for all jobs

4. *Jobs*:
   - validate: terraform fmt -check, terraform validate (MR only)
   - plan: create planfile artifact (MR only)
   - apply: manual approval for main branch, with production environment. terraform plan command should be run in this stage
   - drift-check: scheduled terraform plan with detailed-exitcode
   - destroy: manual with safety conditions (DESTROY_MODE=true + commit message contains DESTROY_CLUSTER)

5. *Slack Notifications*:
   - drift-notify: success/failure messages for scheduled runs
   - failure-notify: pipeline failures with stage context. Notification should wait until the previous stage is completed either automatically or manually. 

   - success-notify: successful pipeline notification with stage context. Notification should wait until the previous stage is completed either automatically or manually. 
6. - Notification jobs use `before_script: []` to skip terraform init



Include all necessary GitLab HTTP backend variables for state management and locking.
